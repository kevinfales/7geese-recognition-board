This is the recognition board.

To get it up and running, be sure to have Node.js installed, as well as CoffeeScript.

Then, you would have install the dependencies.

Type out the following.

    $ cake packages

And you should be already.

## Note

Since the dependencies are loaded via AJAX, then you will need to place the project on some server. You could use something like Apache, RoR, simple-server, etc.
